<B>Biographical material:</B><BR/>
I am a master's student, studying Geographical Information Systems. This is my second project undertaken in Python and with limited experience <BR/>
with many other aspects of coding such as Github and Spyder and with other languages such as HTML. <BR/>

<B> Company Profile:</B><BR/>
The White Star Line is a shipping company that opperates within the Arctic Sea. The company ships encounter many icebergs <BR/>
whilst travelling through these waters. Icebergs are large, dangerous objects which if collided into can cause serious damage. <BR/>
Therefore, the White Star Line shipping company send out an iceberg towing tug along with the ships to reduce the potential for collisions. <BR/>
Using lidar and radar data to assess the size and whether the iceberg can be towed, the company use this code and model to determine the true size of the iceberg. <BR/>

<B>Model Description:</B><BR/>
This online portfolio utilises the Python programming language to produce a graphical user interface of an assessment of a sectioin of sea with an iceberg within.
The model created utlises data sourced from lidar and radar data in the form of text files.<BR/>
These data files are displayed and analysed to check if there is an iceberg within this section of sea. <BR/>
An iceberg is found within this section of ice. <BR/>
This iceberg is then analysed to calculate the area, volume and total mass of the whole iceberg, both above and below the water level. <BR/>
Using this information, the code then determines whether or not the iceberg size is within range to be towed out of the way of an incoming ship.<BR/>
This information is then displayed on a GUI, informing the user of the volume, mass and whether the iceberg can be towed.<BR/>
This information is also written into a text file.<BR/>

<B>The Online Portfolio:</B><BR/>
Link to the online portfolio of the project: <a href="https://github.com/helenamorgan/WhiteStarLine">GitHub Online Portfolio</a><BR/> 
This portfolio includes the Iceberg_Tow.py and IcebergCalculations.py source code which produces the GUI interface.
The portfolio also includes general and auxilary documentation.
